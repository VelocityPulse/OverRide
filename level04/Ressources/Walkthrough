In this level we can see a basic fork where the child will do a gets();

While the child is waiting for the gets, we can see that the parent is waiting the child.
The parent is checking if the child doesnt execute a execv();
Hovewer.. Calling system use a fork before calling execv, so it still allows us to try
to use a system() in the child and execute a /bin/sh.

This exercise is a basic gets() injection, the difficulty is to redirect our injection in the
child stdin and not the parent one.

To do that, we have to use substitution process.

We will write a basic script.py with his usual : 
- RetToLibC
- Padding
- New address of saved EIP
- Print

The (double) substitution process looks like :

(python script.py; cat)> >(./level04)
