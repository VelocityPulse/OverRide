In this level we can see a basic fork where the child will do a gets();

While the child is waiting for the gets, we can see that the parent is waiting the child.
The parent is checking if the child doesnt execute a execv();
Hovewer.. Calling system use a fork before calling execv, so it still allows us to try
to use a system() in the child and execute a /bin/sh.

This exercise is a basinc gets injection, the difficulty is to redirect our injection in the 
child stdin and not the parent.

To do that, we have to use substitution process.

We will write a basic script.py with his usual : 
- RetToLibC
- Padding
- New address of saved EIP
- Print.

The (double) substitution process looks like it :

(python scrypt.py; cat)> >(./level04)
