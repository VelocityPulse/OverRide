In this level, if we read the stack of handle_msg, we can see that there's
two tabs, one initialized to zero, and the other not initialized.
And an int, which contain a value initialized to 0x8c

When we read set_username, and set_msg, it's only a pointer which is given, and they
unreference it like if it was a structure.

It's important because we will have to modify the int of this structure

When we see the first function called, set_username(), we can see that even if the tab is
supposed to stop at 40, the function gets 41 chars, and can copy until 41 chars to the tab

Hopefully at the tab+41, we can find the place where the int variable of the struct is stored.

This int is used later in set_msg as a maximum len.
By overriding this value from 0x8c to 0xff, set_msg will write more in the tab that
it is supposed to do.

And we will be able to write until RIP

- The first padding looks like it : 
"A" * 40 + "\xff" + ("B" * 87)

The 87 B are there to exactly write 128 chars and fill the enteer buffer of the fgets()

- The second padding looks like it :
"C" * 199 + "\x00\x00\x55\x55\x55\x55\x48\x8c"[::-1]

199 is the space between the begining of the tab and RIP

- The third padding is to fill the rest of the set_msg fgets()

"D" * (1022 - len(second_pad))

- The fourth entry is the command to give to the fgets of the secret_backdoor

"cat /home/user/end/.pass"
