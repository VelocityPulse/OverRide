level08 takes a file path and makes a copy of that file into a './backup' directory
which, in the home directoy is owned by level09.

The path to level09/.pass is /home/users/level09/.pass which is a problem because the program will
attempt to backup in ./backups/home/users/level09/.pass , and we can't make the directories to makeup for
that since ./backups is owned by level09

Here we have two options :
1/ We can create a bogus ./backups directory (in /tmp for instance), create the required subdirectories
and execute with that place as a cwd

2/ We can make a symbolic link, let's call him 'link', and point it to /home/users/level09/.pass
This way, the program will create a file named 'link' (with no subdirectories required)
while still opening /home/users/level09/.pass
