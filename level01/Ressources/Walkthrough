There's two fgets, the first fill 256 char in a global variable, 
and the second fill 100 char in a stack, it allows us to write on EIP

We are now allowed to put a shellcode on the stack and run it by re-writing saved EIP

After have re-write saved EIP, we will jump on our shellcode at the end of the program

Depending of our shellcode, we will make it :

push &binsh_var
push &exit
push &system
ret
