On this level we can see that see that login and password are required.
Note : The password should be a number reguarding his scanf conversion "%u"

They are sent to the function auth() which will make a lot of algorithm conversion on the login
string

If the result of the convertion is equal to the password, then it opens us a shell.

The solution is simply to pass a random login, check what algorithm returns like number
And retry with the same login and the number the algorithm returned.

To note : To do this operation, we have to pass the ptrace security by a manual jump
using GDB.
