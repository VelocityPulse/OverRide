In this level, we can see several functions

In main, we can see that a value is get by a scanf, and that it's sent to test()
with another static value which is : 0x1337d00d

in test(); We can see that 0x1337d00d is substracted by the value we entered.
If the result is superior to 0x15, it will jump on a decrypt() with a rand() passed
in parameter.

What we want is to pass our number to decrypt.
In decrypt we can see that there's a xor with our dumber, executed on each character of 
a static string : Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3

To find the good xor, we can go on dcode : https://www.dcode.fr/chiffre-xor
and ask it to try all the possible xor.

We can see in the results that there's a "Congratulations!" result for the xor 0x12
It's a good new because we can see later in decrypt() that if the result of the xor while
equals the string "Congratulations!" it opens a /bin/sh

0x12 is less than 0x15. We can send it to decrypt then.

The procedure will be : 
- To pass the first param of test() 0x1337d00d - 0x12
- So we have to pass 0x1337CFFB (322424827)

- Then 0x1337CFFB will be passed to test
- test will do :  0x1337d00d - 0x1337CFFB
-> 0x12

- Then 0x12 will be sent to decrypt();
- Decrypt will xor all the string by 0x12 and it will result the string "Congratulations!"


A /bin/sh is opened by the this result.
