fgets is called for a 100 bytes buffer in which every character is lowercased if possible

This buffer is then used as a parameter for printf, which allows us to do a format string attack
to write on the got, specificly exit()'s got jump
Instead of jumping on the actuall exit function, we are going to jump on our buffer
in which we put some opcodes to call system with "/bin/sh" as a parameter
