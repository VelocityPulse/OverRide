in this level, we can see that it's a program which have several commands

-store
-read
-quit

The simple purpose of this program is to store a value at an index.
It handles a 400bytes tab, and it store value at the given index<<2

We should send a shellcode or write a ret2libC, unfortunately, there's
a security in store_number. It allows us to write only to :
index % 3 != 0

saved EIP are 456 bytes later the tab.
456 << 2 = 114

Unfortunately 144 % 3 == 0 so we can't overwrite the saved EIP

The solution to counter this security is to add high bit to our number 

114 : 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0111 0010
->    1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0111 0010

which gives : 2147483762
And this number % 3 isn't == 0

By this way we can write to saved EIP with 2147483762 (114)
and write the parameter to our ret2libC at 116
